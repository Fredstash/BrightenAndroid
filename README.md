# Overview

I am learning how to us Android Studio and Kotlin to improve my app development by porting
and IOS app that I have on the app store.
{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}

My app is a service tracking app. The app is currently missing the input data from the user
so the only thing that can be done is view the beacons of light from other service done around the
world. The app reads from a realtime firebase database to display this information, and eventually
my brother and I will set up his old server to send data to the database, and we will migrate our
IOS app to the firebase database.

My purpose of creating this app was to provide an outlet for people to display their service done
for the Light The World initiative done by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I liked
the idea of lighting the world up in a very visual manner so that you can watch the world in realtime
have service done.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop this app

I coded the app using Kotlin. This includes a large amount of libraries, the primary not normal libraries
I used are Firebase and the Google Maps libraries. Since Android Studio is very user friendly it would 
just import the libraries I needed while I was following tutorials and the documentation for each of these
library compilations.

# Useful Websites

* [Google Firebase Database](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Google Map SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/overview)

# Future Work

* The design of the app
* Get user information (including current location data)
* Display the current service count
* Transfer the about information from the other app
